# Basic_Arduino_projects
ðŸš€Basic Arduino Projects This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Arduino projects to help you learn and practice fundamental concepts. Each project includes circuit diagrams, code, and explanations to make learning easier. You can also visualize and simulate the projects using Tinkercad.
ðŸ“Œ Projects Included:
âœ… LED Control using Potentiometer (First Project) ðŸ”¥
âœ… LED Blinking (Using pushbutton)
âœ… LED Bar Graph (Using potentiometer)
âœ… Analog Sensor Reading (LDR, Potentiometer, etc.)
âœ… Digital Sensor Interfacing (PIR, Ultrasonic, etc.)
âœ… Servo Motor Control
âœ… LCD Display Interfacing
âœ… Buzzer and Sound Alerts
âœ… Relay Module for Switching Devices
âœ… Serial Communication Basics

ðŸ›  Requirements:
Arduino Board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
Basic Components (LEDs, Resistors, Sensors, etc.)
Arduino IDE for coding and uploading
ðŸ”— Tinkercad Simulations
You can visualize and test the projects online using Tinkercad! Each project will have a simulation link where you can modify and run the code without needing real hardware.

ðŸ“– How to Use:
Clone this repository
Open the code in Arduino IDE
Follow the circuit diagrams and test on real hardware OR open the Tinkercad link for a virtual simulation
Modify, experiment, and learn!
